# Battleship

## Project goals:
* Gain experience writing unit tests and testable code
* Create a mobile-first design
* Explore responsive design using CSS Grid

## Future improvements:
* Broader test coverage for game states
* Explore solutions (e.g. screenshot testing) to replace manual gameplay testing
* Improve the UX of transitions between players and when a game ends
* Expand design to be more responsive, not just mobile-first
* Additional 'chrome' on the main play screen
